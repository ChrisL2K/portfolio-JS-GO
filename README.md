# Portfolio

## Intro
This is a portfolio website built using no frameworks. It was created with the goal of bettering my JavaScript skills, without the abstractions of frameworks like React or Bootstrap.
It is a Single Page Application, with a very simple content router (found in index.js). Currently, a backend has not been implemented, although it will likely be built using Go and Echo.

## Website
Link will be added once the website is complete and hosted

## Content
The website is divided into 4 major sections:
- Home page, where you can find a hero section introducing my goals and some quick links to other platforms.
- Projects page, displays projects I wish to showcase.
- Resume page, a web resume and a link to a downloadable PDF alternative.
- Contact page, a contact form where you can send me a message (I appreciate feedback).
